	For your questions and comments, there is a <a class="ulink" href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-exim4-users" target="_top">
	Debian-specific mailing	list</a>. Please ask Debian-specific
	questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing

	Debian-specific questions are more likely to find answers on
	our pkg-exim4-users mailing list, while complex custom
	configuration issues might be more easily solved on the
	upstream exim-users mailing list because of the broader and
	more experienced audience there. You can subscribe to

	Similar to the Apache2 package, Exim 4 is an entirely
	different package that does not currently offer a smooth
	upgrade path from Debian's Exim 3 packages.
      </p><p>
	It is the first Exim package in Debian that can be configured
	using debconf. However, the entire configuration framework is
	extremely flexible, allowing you to get exactly the amount of
	control you need for the job at hand.
      </p><p>
	The <a class="ulink" href="http://pkg-exim4.alioth.debian.org" target="_top">development web page</a> contains a lot of
	useful links and other information. The subversion repository
	of the Debian package is available for public read-only access
	and is linked from the development web page.

	  To use Exim 4, you need at least the following packages:
	  </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">exim4-base</span></dt><dd>support files for all Exim MTA (v4) packages</dd><dt><span class="term">exim4-config</span></dt><dd>configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)</dd><dt><span class="term">exim4-daemon-light</span></dt><dd>lightweight exim MTA (v4) daemon</dd></dl></div><p>
	</p><p>
	  Just apting the metapackage <span class="command"><strong>exim4</strong></span> will pull
	  in the other packages per dependency. You'll get an exim daemon
	  with minimal feature set (no external lookups).
	</p><p>
	  If you need more advanced features like LDAP, sqlite, PostgreSQL
	  and MySQL data lookups, SASL and SPA SMTP authentication, embedded
	  Perl interpreter, and exiscan-acl for integration of
	  virus-scanners and SpamAssassin, you can replace
	  <span class="command"><strong>exim4-daemon-heavy</strong></span> instead of
	  <span class="command"><strong>exim4-daemon-light</strong></span>. Additionally, the source
	  package offers infrastructure to build your own custom-tailored
	  exim4-daemon-custom which exactly fits your special local needs. 
	  The infrastructure to do so is already in place, see
	  debian/rules for instructions.

	  The process of building a custom daemon is partially

      Generally, the Debian Exim 4 packages are configured through
      debconf. You have been asked some questions on package installation,
      and your initial Exim configuration has been created from your
      answers. You can repeat the configuration process any time by invoking
      <span class="command"><strong>dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config</strong></span>. If you are an
      experienced Exim administrator and prefer to have your own,
      hand-crafted, non-automatic Exim configuration, you will find
      information about how to do so in
      <a class="xref" href="#completely-different-configuration" title="2.1.6. Using a completely different configuration scheme">Section 2.1.6, &#8220;Using a completely different configuration scheme&#8221;</a>.
    </p><p>
      The debconf-driven configuration is mainly geared for a
      one-domain shell account machine/workstation with local delivery
      as suggested by the original upstream default configuration.
      If you configure the packages to handle more than one local
      domain, all local domains are treated identically. The domain
      part is not used for routing and filtering decisions.
    </p><p>
      Despite the default configuration being extended somewhat from
      the original upstream, chances are that you'll need to
      manually change the Exim configuration with an editor if you intend to
      do something that is not covered by the debconf-driven configuration.
      It has never been the packages' intention to offer all possible
      configuration methods through debconf. The configuration files are
      there to be changed, feel free to do so if you see fit. The Debian
      Exim 4 maintainers have tried to make the configuration as flexible as
      possible so that manual intervention can be minimized.
    </p><p>
      If you need to make manual changes to the Exim configuration,
      please be familiar with how Exim works. At minimum, have read this
      README file and the manpages delivered with the Debian Exim 4
      packages, and <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz</code>
      chapters 3 and 6. <code class="filename">spec.txt.gz</code> is an excellent
      reference.
    </p><p>
      Please note that while most free-form fields in the
      debconf-driven configuration have the entered string end up
      verbatim in Exim's configuration file (and thus using more
      advanced features like host, address and domain lists is possible
      and will probably work), this is not officially supported.
      Only plain lists are supported in the debconf dialogs. You may
      use more advanced features, but they may stop working any time
      during upgrades.

	      In this section, we try to document and explain the debconf
	      questions, which are themselves limited to a small screen of
	      information and might leave questions unanswered. Since you
	      can usually read this file only after having answered the 
	      questions, the process can always be repeated by invoking
	      <span class="command"><strong>dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config.</strong></span> 
	      <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf</code>,
	      documented in the <span class="command"><strong>update-exim4.conf</strong></span>
	      manual page, is
	      a simple shell-script snippet used to store the answers
	      that you passed to debconf when initially configuring Exim.
	      You may also modify this file with an editor of your choice.
	      The package maintainer scripts can handle this and will
	      preserve your changes.

                This is the main configuration question which will
		control which of the remaining questions are
		presented to you. It also controls things like daemon
		invocation and delivery of outgoing mail.

		    This option is suitable for a standalone client system
		    which has restricted internet connectivity, for
		    example on a residential connection where an SMTP
		    smarthost is used. Some ISPs block outgoing SMTP
		    connections to combat the spam problem, thus
		    requiring the use of their smarthosts. It is
		    generally a good idea to use the ISPs smart host
		    if one is connected with a dynamic IP address
		    since quite a few sites do not accept mail
		    directly delivered from a dial-in pool.
		  </p><p>
		    fetchmail can be used to retrieve incoming mail
		    from the ISP's POP3 or IMAP mail server and
		    deliver it to Exim via SMTP.
		  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>

		    This option is suitable for a client system in a
		    computer pool which is not responsible for a local
		    e-mail domain. All locally generated e-mail is
		    sent to the smarthost without any local domains.

		    This option is suitable for a standalone system
		    with no networking at all. Only messages for configured
		    local domains are accepted and delivered locally;
		    messages for all other domains are rejected:
		    ``Mailing to remote domains not supported''.
		  </p></div><div class="section" title="2.1.1.1.5. no configuration at this time"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6 class="title"><a name="idp2167304"></a>2.1.1.1.5. no configuration at this time</h6></div></div></div><p>
		    This option disables most of Debian's automatisms
		    and leaves exim in an unconfigured state.
		    update-exim4.conf will still copy
		    <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template</code>
		    or concatenate the files from
		    <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/conf.d,</code> and will
		    not generate any configuration control macros.
		    Unless you manually edit the configuration source,
		    this will leave Exim with a syntactically invalid
		    configuration file, thus in a state where the
		    daemon won't even start.
		  </p><p>
		    Only choose this option if you know what you're
		    doing and are prepared to create your own Exim
		    configuration.
		  </p><p>
		    dpkg-conffile handling is still in place, and you
		    will be offered updates for configuration
		    snippets, as soon as they become available.

	         The "mail name" is the domain name used to "qualify"
		 mail addresses without a domain name.
	      </p><p>
                 This name will also be used by other programs. It
		 should be the single, full domain name (FQDN).
	      </p><p>
                 For example, if a mail address on the local host is
		 foo@example.org, then the correct value for this
		 option would be example.org.
	      </p><p>
	        Exim, as a rule, handles only fully qualified mail
		addresses, that is, addresses with a local part, an @
		sign and a domain. If confronted with an unqualified
		address, that is, one without @ sign and without
       		domain, first thing exim does is qualify the address
		by adding the @ sign and a domain.
	      </p><p>
	        This qualification happens for all addresses exim
                encounters, be it sender, recipient or else.
              </p><p>
	        The domain name used to qualify unqualified mail addresses
		is called ``mail name'' on Debian systems and entered
                in this debconf dialog. What you enter here will end
		up in <code class="filename">/etc/mailname,</code> which is a
		file that might be used by other programs as well.
	      </p><p>
	        In some configuration types, the package configuration
		will offer you, at a later step, to hide this name 
		from outgoing messages by rewriting the headers.
	      </p></div><div class="section" title="2.1.1.3. IP addresses to listen on for incoming SMTP connections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idp114272"></a>2.1.1.3. IP addresses to listen on for incoming SMTP
	  connections</h5></div></div></div><p>
	        Please enter a semicolon-separated list of IP addresses.
	        The Exim SMTP listener daemon will listen on all IP
	        addresses listed here.
	      </p><p>
	        An empty value will cause Exim to listen for connections
	        on all available network interfaces.
	      </p><p>
	        If this system does only receive e-mail directly from
	        local services (and not from other hosts),
	        it is suggested to prohibit external connections to the
	        local Exim daemon. Such services include e-mail
                programs (MUSs) which talk to localhost only as well as
		fetchmail. External connections are impossible when
	        127.0.0.1 is entered here, as this will disable listening
		on public network interfaces.
	      </p><p>
	        Do not change this unless you know what you are doing.
		Altering this value could post a security risk to your
		system. For most users, the default value is sufficient.

	         Please enter a semicolon-separated list of recipient
		 domains for which this machine should consider itself
		 the final destination. These domains are commonly
                 called 'local domains'. The local hostname and 'localhost'
		 are always added to the list given here.
	      </p><p>
                 By  default  all  local    domains  will   be  treated
		 identically.  If   both a.example and  b.example   are
		 local  domains, acc@a.example   and acc@b.example will
		 be delivered to the  same final   destination.      If
		 different  domain names should be treated differently,
		 it is necessary to edit the config files afterwards.
	      </p><p>
	        The answer to this question ends up in the list of
		domains that Exim will consider local domains. Mail
		for recipients in one of these domains will be
		subject to local alias expansion and then delivered
		locally in the appropriate configuration types.

                If in doubt go for the unsplit config, because it is

          The Debian exim 4 packages come with a default configuration
	  that allows flexible access control and blacklisting of
	  sites and hosts. The acls involved can be found in
	  /etc/exim4/conf.d/acl, or in /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template,
	  depending on which configuration scheme you use. Most
	  rejections of messages due to this mechanism happen at RCPT
	  time. Local configuration of the mechanisms happens through
	  data files in /etc/exim4 or via Exim macros that you can set
	  in /etc/exim4/conf.d/main, so there is normally no need to
	  change the files in the acl subdirectory in a split-config
	  setup. If you use the non-split config, you need to edit
	  /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template, which, as a big
	  dpkg-conffile, won't give you any advantage of the .ifdef
	  scheme.
        </p><p>
          The data files are documented in the exim4-config_files man
          page.
        </p><p>
          The access lists delivered with the exim4 packages also
	  contain quite a few configuration options that are too
	  restrictive to be active by default on a real-life site.
	  These are masked by .ifdef statements, can be activated by
	  setting the appropriate macros, and are documented in the
	  ACL files itself.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="2.1.3. Using Exim Macros to control the configuration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="macros"></a>2.1.3. Using Exim Macros to control the
      configuration</h4></div></div></div><p>
	Our configuration can be controlled in a limited way by
	setting macros. That way, you can switch on and off certain
	parts of the default configuration and/or override values set
        in Debconf without having to touch the dpkg-conffiles. While
	touching dpkg-conffiles itself is explitly allowed and wanted,
	it can be quite a nuisance to be asked on package upgrade
	whether one wants to use the locally changed file or the
	file changed by the package maintainer.
      </p><p>
	Whenever you see an <span class="command"><strong>.ifdef</strong></span> or
	<span class="command"><strong>.ifndef</strong></span> clause in the configuration file,
	you can control the appropriate clause by setting the macro in
	a local configuration file. For split configuration, you can
	drop the local configuration file anywhere in
	<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/conf.d/main</code>. Just make sure it
	gets read before the macro is first used. 
	<code class="filename">000_localmacros</code> is a possible name,
	guaranteeing first order. For a non-split configuration,
	<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros</code> gets
	read before
	<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template</code>. To
	actually set the macro <code class="varname">EXIM4_EXAMPLE</code> to the
	value "this is a sample", write the following line
      </p><p>
	EXIM4_EXAMPLE = this is a sample
      </p><p>
	into the appropriate file. For more detailed discussion of the
	general macro mechanism, see the Exim specification, chapter
	6.4, for details how macro expansion works.

	  The script <span class="command"><strong>update-exim4.conf</strong></span> parses the

	  The debconf-managed information from

	  which holds the answer to "Which machine will act as the
	  smarthost and handle outgoing mail?"

	    You can, of course, make direct change to the
	    configuration. All configuration files in /etc/exim4 are
	    dpkg-conffiles, and you can thus edit them any time. Your
	    changes will be preserved through updates. You need to
            know about how to configure Exim to be successful.
	  </p><p>
	    If you use unsplit configuration, edit
            <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template</code>. If you use
	    split configuration, edit the Exim configuration snippets in
	    <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/conf.d</code>.
	  </p><p>
	    More information about how the Exim configuration is built

	  If you are an experienced Exim administrator, you might feel

	  cumbersome and complex. You might feel right if you need to
	  make more complex changes and do not need to receive updates
	  from us. This section is going to tell about how to use
	  your own configuration.
	</p><p>
	  But, you might profit from keeping the Debian magic. Most
	  files that come with Debian exim4 are conffiles. Debian is
	  going to care about your changes and keeps them around.
	  Additionally, a lot of configuration options can be
	  overridden with a macro, which does not require you to
	  actually change our configuration file. A lot of people are
	  using our configuration scheme, and maybe it is going to
	  save you a lot of time if you decide to spend some time
	  familiarizing yourself with our scheme.

	    	If you are only running a small number of systems and
		want to completely disable Debian's magic, just take
		your monolithic configuration file and install it as
		<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf</code>. Exim will
		use that file verbatim. To have something to start,
		you can either take
		<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template</code>, 
		run <span class="command"><strong>update-exim4.conf --keepcomments --output
		/etc/exim4/exim4.conf</strong></span>, or use upstream's
		default configuration file that is installed as
		<code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/exim4-base/examples/example.conf.gz</code>.
		You are going to lose all magic you get from packaging
		though, so you need to be familiar with Exim to build
		an actually working config.
	    </p><p>
		<code class="filename">/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated</code>,
		the file generated by
		<span class="command"><strong>update-exim4.conf</strong></span>, is ignored as soon
		as <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf</code> is found. 
		You should not edit
		<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf</code> directly when
		Exim is running, because the forked processes Exim starts
		for SMTP receiving or queue running would use the new
		configuration file, while the original main exim-daemon
		would still use the old configuration file.
	    </p><p>
	    	Some third-party HOWTOs that reference Debian and
		claim to make things easy suggest dumping a
		pre-fabricated, static config file to
		<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf</code>. This is
		considered bad advice by the Debian maintainers since
		you are going to disable all updates and service magic
		that Debian might deliver in the future this way. If
		you do not know exactly what you're doing here, this
		is a bad choice. We try to comment on external HOWTOs

	  Both exim4-daemon-heavy and exim4-daemon-light support TLS/SSL
	  using the GnuTLS library and STARTTLS. Exim will use TLS
	  via STARTTLS <span class="emphasis"><em>automatically</em></span> as client if
	  the server Exim connects to offers it.
	</p><p>
	  This means that you will not need any special configuration if
	  you want to use TLS for outgoing mail. However, if your
	  server setup mandates the use of client certificates, you
	  need to amend your remote_smtp and/or remote_smtp_smarthost
	  transports with a tls_certificate option. This is not
          commonly needed.
	</p><p>
	  The certificate
	  presented by the remote host is not checked unless you
	  specify a tls_verify_certificate option on the transport.
	</p><p>
	   TLS on connect is not natively supported.
	</p></div><div class="section" title="2.2.2. Enabling TLS support for Exim as server"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp3441448"></a>2.2.2. Enabling TLS support for Exim as server</h4></div></div></div><p>
	  You should have created certificates in
	  <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/</code> either by hand or by usage of
	  the exim-gencert (which requires openssl). exim-gencert is
	  shipped in
	  <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/exim4-base/examples/</code> and
	  takes care of proper access privileges on the private key
	  file.
	</p><p>
	  Now, enable TLS by setting the macro MAIN_TLS_ENABLE in a
	  local configuration file as described in <a class="xref" href="#macros" title="2.1.3. Using Exim Macros to control the configuration">Section 2.1.3, &#8220;Using Exim Macros to control the
      configuration&#8221;</a>.
	</p><p>
	  After this configuration, Exim will advertise STARTTLS when
	  connected to on the normal SMTP ports. Some broken clients
          (most prominent example being nearly all versions of Microsoft
	  Outlook and Outlook Express, and Incredimail) insist on doing
	  TLS on connect on Port 465. If you need to support these, set
	  SMTPLISTENEROPTIONS='-oX 465:25 -oP /var/run/exim4/exim.pid'
	  in <code class="filename">/etc/default/exim4</code> and
	  "tls_on_connect_ports=465" in the main configuration section.
	</p><p>
	  The -oP is needed because Exim does not write an implicit pid
	  file if -oX is given. Without pid file, init script and cron
          job will malfunction.
	</p><p>
	  It might be appropriate to add "+tls_cipher +tls_peerdn" to
	  any log_selector statement you might already have, or to add a
	  log_selector statement setting these two options in a local
	  configuration file. These options have Exim log what cipher
	  your Exim and the peer's mailer have negotiated to use to
	  encrypt the transaction, and they have Exim log the
	  Distinguished Name of the peer's certificate.
	</p><p>
	  Exim can be configured to ask a client for a certificate and to
	  try to verify it. Debian's exim configuration used to enable
	  this by default, but stopped doing so since it caused TLS errors
	  with a couple of popular clients (Outlook, Incredimail, etc.).
	  To enable this again set the macro MAIN_TLS_TRY_VERIFY_HOSTS to
	  the lists hosts whose certificates you want to check. (Use * to
	  try checking all hosts. The value of the macro is used to
	  populate exim's main option tls_try_verify_hosts.) You should
	  also point MAIN_TLS_VERIFY_CERTIFICATES to a file containing the
	  accepted certificates, since its default setting
	  (/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt) can contain a large list of
	  certificates which causes the interoperabilty problems with
	  Outlook et.al. noted above.
	</p></div><div class="section" title="2.2.3. Troubleshooting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp3446536"></a>2.2.3. Troubleshooting</h4></div></div></div><p>
	  If Exim complains in an SMTP session that TLS is unavailable,
	  the Exim mainlog or paniclog frequently has exact information
	  about what might be wrong. Fo example, you might see
	</p><p>
	  2003-01-27 19:06:45 TLS error on connection from localhost [127.0.0.1]
	  (cert/key setup): Error while reading file)
	</p><p>
	  showing that there has been an error while accessing the
	  certificate or the private key file.
	</p><p>
	  Insuffient entropy available is a frequent cause of TLS
          failures in Exim context. If Exim logs "not enough random bytes
	  available", or simply hangs silently when an encrypted
          connection should be established, then Exim was
	  unable to read enough random data from
	  <code class="filename">/dev/random</code> to do whatever cryptographic
	  operation is requested. Please check that your
	  <code class="filename">/dev/random</code> device is setup properly.
	</p><p>
	  You might also find "TLS error on connection to [...]
	  (gnutls_handshake): The Diffie-Hellman prime sent by the server is
	  not acceptable (not long enough)." given as reason. Exim by default
	  requires a DH prime length of 1024 bits. This requirement can be
	  downgraded by setting the tls_dh_min_bits option on the SMTP
	  transport.  The setting is accessible in the Debian configuration by
	  setting the macro TLS_DH_MIN_BITS. (e.g. "TLS_DH_MIN_BITS = 768").
	</p></div></div><div class="section" title="2.3. SMTP-AUTH"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="smtp-auth"></a>2.3. SMTP-AUTH</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Exim can do SMTP AUTH both as a client and as a server.
      </p><p>
	AUTH PLAIN and AUTH LOGIN are disabled for connections which are
	not protected by SSL/TLS per default. These authentication
	methods use cleartext passwords, and allowing the
	transmission of cleartext passwords on unencrypted connections
	is a security risk. Therefore, the default configuration configures
	Exim not to use and/or allow AUTH PLAIN and AUTH LOGIN over
        unencrypted connections.
      </p><p>
        It is thus recommended to set up Exim to use TLS to encrypt
        the connections. Please refer to <a class="xref" href="#TLS" title="2.2. Using TLS">Section 2.2, &#8220;Using TLS&#8221;</a> for
        documentation about this. Note that most Microsoft clients

	  If you want to set up Exim as SMTP AUTH client for delivery

          page for exim4-config_files(5) for more information about the
	  required format.
	</p><p>
	  If you need to enable AUTH PLAIN or AUTH LOGIN for unencrypted
	  connections because your service provider does support neither
	  TLS encryption nor the CRAM MD5 authentication method, you can
	  do so by setting the AUTH_CLIENT_ALLOW_NOTLS_PASSWORDS macro.

	</p><p>
	  <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/passwd.client</code> needs to be

	  If you want to authenticate against system passwords (e.g. 
	  <code class="filename">/etc/shadow</code>) the easiest way is to use
	  saslauthd in the Debian package sasl2-bin. You have to add the
	  exim-user (currently Debian-exim) to the sasl group, to give
	  exim permission to use the saslauthd service.

        Since system accounts (mail, uucp, lp etc) are usually aliased
	to root, and root's mailbox is usually read by a human, these
	account names have started to be a common target for spammers.
	The Debian Exim 4 packages have a mechanism to deal with this
	situation. However, since this derives rather far from normal
	behavior, it is disabled by default.
      </p><p>
        To enable it, set the macro FIRST_USER_ACCOUNT_UID to a numeric,
	non-zero value. Incoming mail for local users that have a UID
	lower than FIRST_USER_ACCOUNT_UID is rejected with the message "no
	mail to system accounts". Incoming mail for local users that
	have a UID greater or equal FIRST_USER_ACCOUNT_UID are processed as
	usual. Therefore, the default value of 0 ensures that the
	mechanism is disabled. On Debian systems, setting
	FIRST_USER_ACCOUNT_UID to 500 or 1000 (depending on your local policy)
	will disable incoming mail for system accounts.
      </p><p>
        Just in case that you need exceptions to the rule,
	<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/lowuid_aliases</code> is an alias
	file that is only honored for local accounts with UID lower
	than FIRST_USER_ACCOUNT_UID. If you define an alias for such an
	account here, incoming mail is processed according to the
	alias. If you alias the account to itself, messages are
	delivered to the account itself, which is an exception to the
	rule that messages for low-UID accounts are rejected. The
	format of <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/lowuid_aliases</code> is
	just another alias file.
      </p></div><div class="section" title="2.8. How to bypass local routing specialities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp3481552"></a>2.8. How to bypass local routing specialities</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Sometimes, it might be desireable to be able to bypass local
	routing specialities like the alias file or a user-forward
	file. This is possible in the Debian Exim4 packages by
	prefixing the account name with "real-". For a local account
	name "foo", "real-foo@hostname.example" will result in direct
	delivery to foo's local Mailbox.
      </p><p>
        This feature is by default only available for locally
	generated messages. If you want it to be accessible for
	messages delivered from remote as well, set the Exim macro
	COND_LOCAL_SUBMITTER to true. If you do not want this at all,
	set the macro to false. Please note that the userforward
	router uses this feature to get error messages delivered, i.e.
	notifying the user of a syntax error in her
	<code class="filename">.forward</code> file.

	Delivery to arbitrary files, directory or to pipes in the
	<code class="filename">/etc/aliases</code> file is disabled by default
	in the Debian Exim 4 packages. The delivery process including the
	program being piped to would run as the exim admin-user
	Debian-exim, which might open up security holes.
      </p><p>
	Invoking pipes from <code class="filename">/etc/aliases</code> file is
	widely considered obsolete and deprecated. The Debian Exim
	package maintainers would like to suggest using a dedicated
	router/transport pair to invoke local processes for mail
	processing. For example, the Debian mailman package contains a
	<code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/mailman/README.Exim4.Debian</code> file
	that gives a good example how to implement this. Using a
	dedicated router/transport pair have the following advantages:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
	      The router/transport pair can be put in place by another
	      package, giving a well-defined transaction point between
	      Exim 4 and $PACKAGE.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Not allowing pipe deliveries from alias files makes it
	      harder to accidentally run programs with wrong
	      privileges.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      It is possible to run different pipe processes under
	      different accounts.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Even if only invoking a single local program, it is easier
	      to do with your dedicated router/transport since you won't
	      need to change this file, making automatic updates of this
	      file possible for future versions of the Exim 4 packages. If
	      you do local changes here, dpkg conffile handling will

	If you insist on using <code class="filename">/etc/aliases</code> in
	the traditional way, you will need to activate the
	respective functions by setting the transport options on the
        system_aliases router appropriately. Macros are defined to make
	this easier. See
       
<code class="filename">/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/400_exim4-config_system_aliases</code>
	for information about which macros are available. You might
        find the address_file, address_pipe and/or address_directory
        transports that are used for the userforward router helpful in
	writing your own transports for use in the system_aliases router.
      </p><p>
	If any of your aliases expand to pipes or files or directories
	you should set up a user and a group for these deliveries to run
	under. You can do this by setting the "user" and - if necessary
	- a "group" option and adding a "group" option if necessary. 
	Alternatively, you can specify "user" and/or "group" on the
	transports that are used.

	UUCP is a traditional way to execute remote jobs (e.g. spool
	mails), and as a lot of old things there are much more than one
	way to do it. However, today, the ways to handle it have boiled
	down to more or less two different ways.
      </p><p>
	Our recommendation is to use bsmtp/rsmtp wherever possible,
	because it supports all kinds of mail addresses (also the empty
	ones in bounces), and is also better from the security point of
	view.
      </p><div class="section" title="2.10.1. Sending mail via UUCP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp3491432"></a>2.10.1. Sending mail via UUCP</h4></div></div></div><div class="section" title="2.10.1.1. rmail with full addresses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idp3491752"></a>2.10.1.1. rmail with full addresses</h5></div></div></div><p>
	    rmail is the oldest way to transfer mail to a remote system. 
	    However, today it is normally required to use addresses with
	    full domains for that (Well, they look like any normal address
	    for you, and we do not tell about the other way to not confuse
	    you ;). If you want this, you can use this transport:
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
rmail:
    debug_print = "T: rmail for $pipe_addresses"
    driver=pipe
    command = uux - -r -a$sender_address -gC $domain_data!rmail $pipe_addresses
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 20
	  </pre><p>
	    However, all recipients are handled via the command line, so
	    you are discouraged to use it.
	  </p></div><div class="section" title="2.10.1.2. bsmtp/rsmtp"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idp3493512"></a>2.10.1.2. bsmtp/rsmtp</h5></div></div></div><p>
	    This is a more efficient way to transfer mails. It works
	    like sending SMTP via a pipe, but instead of waiting for an
	    answer, the SMTP is just batched; from this is also the name
	    batched SMTP or short bsmtp.
	  </p><p>
	    Furthermore, this way won't fail on addresses like "
	    "@do.main. If you want this, please use this, if the remote
	    site uses rsmtp (e.g. is Exim 4):
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
rsmtp:
    debug_print = "T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses"
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a$sender_address -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
	  </pre><p>
	    and this if it wants bsmtp as the command:
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
bsmtp:
    debug_print = "T: bsmtp for $pipe_addresses"
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a$sender_address -gC $domain_data!bsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
	  </pre><p>
	    Of course, these examples can be extended for e.g. 
	    compression (but you can also use ssh for compression, if
	    you want).
	  </p></div><div class="section" title="2.10.1.3. The router"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="idp3496384"></a>2.10.1.3. The router</h5></div></div></div><p>
	    You need a router to tell Exim 4 which mails to forward to
	    UUCP. You can use this one; please adopt the last line. Of
	    course, it is also possible to send mail via more than one way.
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
uucp_router:
    debug_print = "R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain"
    driver=accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
	  </pre><p>
	    The file <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/uucp</code> looks like:
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
*.do.main       uucp.name.of.remote.side

	    If you have a leaf system (i.e. all your mail not for your
	    local system goes to a single remote system), you can just
	    forward all non-local mail to the remote UUCP system. In
	    this case, you can replace "domains = ..." with "domains = ! 
	    +local_domains", but then you need also to replace
	    $domain_data in the transport by the UUCP-name of your
	    smarthost. The file <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/uucp</code> is
	    not needed in this case.

      If you use <span class="command"><strong>exim4-config</strong></span> from Debian, you will
      get the debconf based configuration scheme that is intended to
      cover the majority of cases.
    </p><p>
      If <span class="command"><strong>exim4-config</strong></span> is installed while an Exim 3
      package is present on the system,
      <span class="command"><strong>exim4-config</strong></span> tries to parse the Exim 3 config
      file to determine the answers that were given to
      <span class="command"><strong>eximconfig</strong></span> on Exim 3 installation. These
      answers are then taken as default values for the debconf based
      configuration process. Be warned! <span class="command"><strong>eximconfig</strong></span>
      from the Exim 3 packages does not record the explicit answers
      given on Exim 3 configuration. So we have to guess the answers
      from the Exim 3 configuration file
      <code class="filename">/etc/exim/exim.conf</code>, which is bound to fail
      if the config file has been modified after using
      <span class="command"><strong>eximconfig</strong></span>.
    </p><p>
      This is the reason why we refrained from doing a "silent update", but
      only use the guessed answers to get reasonable defaults for our
      debconf based configuration process.
    </p><p>
      Please note that we do not use the
      <span class="command"><strong>exim_convert4r4</strong></span> script, but try to configure
      the Exim 4 package in the same way Exim 3 was. This will
      hopefully aid future updates.
    </p><p>
      If you have used a customized Exim 3 configuration, you can of
      course use <span class="command"><strong>exim_convert4r4</strong></span>, and install the
      resulting file as <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/exim4.conf</code>
      after careful inspection. Exim 4 will then use that file and
      ignore the file that it generated from the debconf
      configuration. To aid future updates, we do, however, encourage
      you not to use the
      <code class="filename">exim_convert4r4-generated</code> file verbatim but
      instead drop appropriate configuration snippets in their
      appropriate place in <code class="filename">/etc/exim4/conf.d</code>.
    </p></div><div class="section" title="4. Misc Notes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp3509472"></a>4. Misc Notes</h2></div></div></div><div class="section" title="4.1. PAM"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp3509792"></a>4.1. PAM</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  PAM: On Debian systems the PAM modules run as the same user
	  as the calling program, so they cannot do anything you
	  could not do yourself, and in particular cannot access
	  <code class="filename">/etc/shadow</code> unless the user is in group
	  shadow. - If you want to use
	  <code class="filename">/etc/shadow</code> for Exim's SMTP AUTH you
	  will need to run exim as group shadow.  Only
	  exim4-daemon-heavy is linked against libpam. We suggest using
	  saslauthd instead.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="4.2. Account name restrictions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp3511432"></a>4.2. Account name restrictions</h3></div></div></div><p>
          In the default configuration, Exim cannot locally deliver
          mail to accounts which have capitals in their name. This is
          caused by the fact that Exim converts the local part of incoming
          mail to lower case before the comparision done by the
          check_local_user directive in routers is done.
        </p><p>
          The router option caseful_local_part can be used to control
          this, and we decided not to set this option in the Debian
          configuration since it would be a rather big change to Exim's
          default behavior.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="4.3. No deliveries to root!"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp3512808"></a>4.3. No deliveries to root!</h3></div></div></div><p>
            No Exim 4 version released with any Debian OS can run
	    deliveries as root. If you don't redirect mail for root via
            <code class="filename">/etc/aliases</code> to a nonprivileged
            account, the mail will be delivered to
	    <code class="filename">/var/mail/mail</code> with permissions 0600 and
            owner mail:mail.
	</p><p>
	    This redirection is done by the mail4root router which
            is last in the list and will thus catch mail for root that has not
            been taken care of earlier.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="4.4. Debugging maintainer and init scripts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp3514704"></a>4.4. Debugging maintainer and init scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>
	    Most of the scripts that come with this Debian package do a
	    <span class="command"><strong>set -x</strong></span> if invoked with the environment
	    variable EX4DEBUG defined and non-zero. This is particularly
	    handy if you need to debug the maintainer scripts that are
	    invoked during package installation. Since dpkg redirects
	    stdout of maintainer scripts, calling dpkg with EX4DEBUG
	    set might yield interesting results. If in doubt, invoke
	    the maintainer scripts with EX4DEBUG set manually directly
	    from the command line.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="4.5. SELinux"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp3516176"></a>4.5. SELinux</h3></div></div></div><p>
            There is no SELinux policy for Exim4 available so far.
	    Until this is resolved, users should use postfix or
	    sendmail if they intend to run SELinux.
        </p><p>
	    The Debian Exim4 maintainers would appreciate if
            somebody could write an SELinux policy. We will gladly
	    use them in the Debian packages as long as there is
	    somebody available to test, debug and support.
